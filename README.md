# Cains Voyage

This is a mod for the game [The Binding of Isaac](https://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/The_Binding_of_Isaac/)

This is the first version of Cain's Voyage. Currently, your health is tied to your coin amount, so spend wisely. (a lot like keeper right now but changes may be made in the future)

# Known bugs 

IV bag creates infinite money (VERY BROKEN)
Head of the keeper is applied to the player every time the run loads (stackable)
